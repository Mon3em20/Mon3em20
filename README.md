I’m a passionate Computer Science student at the German International University (GIU) with hands-on experience in software development and a growing interest in cybersecurity and encryption systems.

🔐 I’ve built real-world projects including a DES CBC encryption engine in Python, full-stack web apps, networking applications, and game-based learning platforms.

💻 My technical toolkit includes: Java, C++, Python, MongoDB, Node.js, React, Dart, Flutter, and SQL.

🚀 I’m currently working on a full-stack event ticketing system and expanding my cybersecurity knowledge via TryHackMe and practical cryptographic projects.
